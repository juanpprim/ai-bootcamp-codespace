    "\n",
    "Research process:\n",
    "\n",
    "stage 1: initial exploration  \n",
    "- Perform one broad search query to understand the main topic and identify related areas.  \n",
    "- Summarize key concepts, definitions, and major themes.  \n",
    "\n",
    "stage 2: broad expansion  \n",
    "- Perform 5–6 targeted queries based on findings from stage 1.  \n",
    "- Explore adjacent and contextual topics to build a broader understanding.  \n",
    "- Identify key debates, challenges, frameworks, and major contributors.  \n",
    "\n",
    "stage 3: deep investigation  \n",
    "- Perform 5–6 refined queries focusing on depth.  \n",
    "- Investigate specific mechanisms, case studies, technical details, or research gaps.  \n",
    "- Gather diverse viewpoints and data to strengthen depth and accuracy.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Final deliverable:\n",
    "\n",
    "Produce a complete research report as valid JSON that fits the ResearchReport schema.  \n",
    "The article must be long, detailed, and divided into multiple sections and paragraphs — not short summaries.\n",
    "\n",
    "Rules:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Search queries:\n",
    "   - Do not include years (e.g., “2023,” “2024”) unless explicitly part of the user’s request.\n",
    "   - Always use timeless, general, or concept-based queries (e.g., “AI investment trends” instead of “AI investment trends 2023”).\n",
    "   - Prefer queries that help build depth, context, and connections across subtopics.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. The article must contain:\n",
    "   - A clear, descriptive title.\n",
    "   - An introduction with 2–3 paragraphs (each 4–6 sentences).\n",
    "   - At least 10 sections, ideally 10–12, each focused on a distinct subtopic.\n",
    "   - Each section must have at least 4 paragraphs, preferably 5–6.\n",
    "   - Each paragraph must contain 4–6 sentences of original synthesis.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Each paragraph must have at least one reference object containing:\n",
    "   - video_id (YouTube video ID)\n",
    "   - timestamp (\"mm:ss\" or \"h:mm:ss\")\n",
    "   - quote (a short excerpt or paraphrase from that video segment)\n",
    "   - Do not embed citations inline in the text.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. The conclusion must have 2–3 paragraphs summarizing the key findings and implications.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Structure and coherence:\n",
    "   - Each section must have a unique title describing its focus.\n",
    "   - Paragraphs within a section must explore different but related ideas.\n",
    "   - The narrative should flow logically across sections.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Evidence quality:\n",
    "   - All claims must be traceable to real YouTube sources.\n",
    "   - References must correspond to valid video_id and timestamp pairs.\n",
    "   - Quotes should reflect the video’s spoken content accurately.\n",
    "   - Do not fabricate data or sources.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. Depth and length requirements:\n",
    "   - If the output has fewer than 10 sections or any section has fewer than 4 paragraphs, it is invalid.\n",
    "   - If any paragraph has no references, it is invalid.\n",
    "   - The report should read like an in-depth, long-form synthesis, not a short article.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. Tone and style:\n",
    "   - Write in a professional, neutral, analytical tone.\n",
    "   - Emphasize explanation, synthesis, and comparison.\n",
    "   - Avoid repetition and filler text.\n",
    "\n",
    "9. Output format:\n",
    "   - Produce valid JSON following the ResearchReport model.\n",
    "   - Do not include markdown, headings, or inline links.\n",
    "   - Populate all required fields: stages, article, sections, paragraphs, references.\n",
    "\n",
    "10. Self-check before completion:\n",
    "   - Confirm you have 10–12 sections.\n",
    "   - Confirm each section has 4–6 paragraphs.\n",
    "   - Confirm each paragraph has 4–6 sentences.\n",
    "   - Confirm each paragraph has at least one valid reference object.\n",
    "   - Confirm introduction and conclusion both contain 2–3 paragraphs.\n",
    "\n",
    "11. Keyword and query integrity:\n",
    "\n",
    "- For each research stage, the list of keywords in StageReport.keywords must exactly match the queries actually used in TOOL CALLs.\n",
    "- Do not invent or summarize keywords. Only include the literal query strings that were passed to the search function.\n",
    "- If a query was modified before searching (e.g., sanitized to remove years), include the final version actually executed.\n",
    "- The StageReport.summary may interpret or discuss what was found, but may not add new or implied keywords that were not searched.\n",
    "- If fewer or more keywords were used than planned, report exactly how many were executed — not how many were intended.\n",
    "- The final report must remain consistent: every keyword listed must correspond to one real search call, and no others.\n",

      "In recent years, the advent of artificial intelligence (AI) has transformed multiple sectors, giving rise to various methods of monetization. As businesses recognize AI's potential, questions surrounding how to effectively harness these technologies for financial gain have become paramount. This report delves deeply into the multifaceted approaches for making money with AI, ranging from consulting practices and product development to investment avenues and entrepreneurial ventures. It explores how businesses can strategically implement AI technologies to maximize revenue and establish a competitive edge in an evolving market.\n",
      "\n",
      "AI isn't simply a technological marvel; it's an avenue for innovation and economic growth. As startups and established companies alike pivot towards AI, this report aims to provide a comprehensive overview of how AI can be monetized effectively in today's dynamic business landscape. By understanding core strategies and emerging opportunities in the sector, stakeholders can make informed decisions about engaging AI to enhance their business models.\n",

      "## Understanding AI as a Monetizable Asset\n",
      "\n",
      "AI technologies have evolved over the last decade, presenting unique monetization opportunities through various business models. Companies are increasingly recognizing AI's potential to improve operational efficiencies, enhance customer experiences, and generate new revenue streams.
