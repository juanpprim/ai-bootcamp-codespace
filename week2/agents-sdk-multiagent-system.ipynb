       "1:14 Today on the podcast, we are joined by\n",
       "1:17 Abazar. He's worked on data and ML\n",
       "1:19 projects in very different places from\n",
       "1:21 amusement parks to e-commerce and now\n",
       "1:23 Tesla. We'll talk about how to turn data\n",
       "1:26 into real products, what it means to\n",
       "1:28 productionize machine learning and what\n",
       "1:30 is the future of data and ML\n",
       "1:31 engineering. So, welcome to our event.\n",
       "1:35 Thank you. Happy to be here.\n",
       "1:38 So, let's start with um your career\n",
       "1:41 journey so far. Can you tell us about\n",
       "1:42 this?\n",
       "1:44 Uh yeah so uh my background is software\n",
       "1:48 engineering. uh I got my bachelor and\n",
       "1:51 master in software engineering basically\n",
       "1:55 computer engineering from Iran and then\n",
       "1:58 I worked for a couple of years in a\n",
       "2:00 telecom company and after a while I\n",
       "2:03 thought okay this is getting boring\n",
       "2:06 uh since you have to develop a lot of\n",
       "2:08 things and you have to also support it\n",
       "2:11 and if it's like for a couple of years\n",
       "2:13 it's going to be a lot of things that\n",
       "2:14 you have to support. So I thought okay\n",
       "2:18 um maybe it's time to go after something\n",
       "2:23 like that I like more and I worked on my\n",
       "2:26 master thesis is also on the same topic.\n",
       "2:29 It was like machine learning uh like\n",
       "2:32 more like data science\n",
       "2:35 uh topics. So I was looking just for\n",
       "2:39 like different universities that have uh\n",
       "2:42 like a similar program or I can like\n",
       "2:45 further study data science to understand\n",
       "2:47 it more. uh so I came across a program\n",
       "2:51 in otovan tu otoven university that is\n",
       "2:55 called uh it was called actually\n",
       "2:58 professional doctorate in data science\n",
       "3:01 now it's called engineering doctorate\n",
       "3:05 actually they changed the name because\n",
       "3:07 of some overlap issues uh yeah I applied\n",
       "3:11 when was it huh\n",
       "3:13 sorry\n",
       "3:13 when when was it\n",
       "3:15 this was 2018 18\n",
       "3:19 18 yeah I was applying a little earlier\n",
       "3:21 as we spoke a little before the\n",
       "3:23 interview so I was also considering\n",
       "3:25 Einhovven University for my masters and\n",
       "3:28 I I think I have a very similar\n",
       "3:32 at least the beginning of my career\n",
       "3:33 journey was quite similar so I was a\n",
       "3:34 software engineer and I was getting\n",
       "3:36 bored like I was working at a bank and\n",
       "3:39 I'm like do I really want to do this for\n",
       "3:41 the rest of my life and then I found out\n",
       "3:43 that there is this machine learning\n",
       "3:45 thing and I thought oh that's so school\n",
       "3:47 and I and Hoen University was one of the\n",
       "3:49 universities I was considering uh\n",
       "3:52 applying. It's very interesting.\n",
       "3:55 Yeah. Yeah. I I don't remember how it\n",
       "3:57 was called though. Um yeah, but I I\n",
       "4:00 remember it was um\n",
       "4:03 that university and yeah, I really like\n",
       "4:06 the program, but I I chose a different\n",
       "4:07 one at the end.\n",
       "4:09 Okay. Which which university did you go\n",
       "4:10 to?\n",
       "4:11 So um I graduated from TU Berlin.\n",
       "4:14 Oh, okay. And now I am in Berlin.\n",
       "4:17 Nice, nice, nice.\n",
       "4:19 Yeah. So those years I guess it was like\n",
       "4:23 OpenAI just launched their thing and\n",
       "4:26 like they started like two or three\n",
       "4:28 years before and it was like a hot topic\n",
       "4:32 in especially in the Netherlands or I\n",
       "4:34 think also in the in Germany it was like\n",
       "4:37 very hot topic. So also you could go\n",
       "4:40 around and see all the companies that\n",
       "4:42 whether they are mature to use these\n",
       "4:44 models or not. So it was a fun I think\n",
       "4:48 those years fun years to start actually.\n",
       "4:51 So yeah I started that program. Uh I was\n",
       "4:55 it's it was like a two-year program. It\n",
       "4:58 was like it it's not a PhD obviously but\n",
       "5:00 it's like a\n",
       "5:01 we call it doctorate. It's confusing\n",
       "5:03 right? Yeah, it's confusing actually,\n",
       "5:05 but it's like research plus practical\n",
       "5:08 practical work. So, they pay you\n",
       "5:12 basically to study. That was that's that\n",
       "5:14 was amazing opportunity.\n",
       "5:16 Ah, that's a good deal. I I didn't have\n",
       "5:18 this deal. So, what they offered me is\n",
       "5:20 uh partial scholarship.\n",
       "5:24 Yeah, that was not enough.\n",
       "5:26 Yeah, this is was also like you get the\n",
       "5:29 minimum wage.\n",
       "5:30 Uhhuh. Yeah, that's that's really cool.\n",
       "5:32 That's awesome.\n",
       "5:33 Was enough I think for like a student\n",
       "5:36 life it was enough I think.\n",
       "5:38 Yeah. And yeah I during that program\n",
       "5:41 it's basically like you work with a lot\n",
       "5:43 of Dutch companies that kind of sponsor\n",
       "5:45 the program. Uh\n",
       "5:48 like yeah like I think\n",
       "5:50 Philips right\n",
       "5:51 four or five sorry\n",
       "5:52 like Philips.\n",
       "5:54 Yeah Philillips ASML\n",
       "5:56 uh like we worked with Hendricks\n",
       "5:59 Genetics. They were like breeding\n",
       "6:00 turkeys and stuff. Uh it was a lot of\n",
       "6:04 cool companies that you got to work with\n",
       "6:06 even municipalities.\n",
       "6:07 Mhm.\n",
       "6:08 Uh yeah, a lot of companies actually\n",
       "6:10 worked very closely with TOE. So it was\n",
       "6:13 really cool.\n",
       "6:15 That's\n",
       "6:17 went to Etink then want to went to\n",
       "6:20 Bulpoint and now\n",
       "6:23 Okay. And this uh you just oh at the end\n",
       "6:27 after that I went to Eel was link\n",
       "6:32 and then b.com but like these are um I\n",
       "6:35 have no knowledge about this\n",
       "6:39 link but this is an amusement park from\n",
       "6:41 what I see. What is this? What did you\n",
       "6:44 do there?\n",
       "6:45 Cuz I also like sorry for interrupting\n",
       "6:48 you. I also worked at an amusement park\n",
       "6:50 but\n",
       "6:51 I was an right operator. So, I was\n",
       "6:54 actually like letting kids in and then I\n",
       "6:56 was making sure they don't kill\n",
       "6:58 themselves. That was my job.\n",
       "7:00 I think yours was different, right?\n",
       "7:02 A bit different. Uh\n",
       "7:05 I mean, yeah. So, it was the story like\n",
       "7:09 basically starts from my second year. In\n",
       "7:11 the second year of our program, we had\n",
       "7:13 to have a long project, right? So, for\n",
       "7:16 that one year project, I either had to\n",
       "7:19 go uh with the banks. So it was like a\n",
       "7:22 collision between banks and police that\n",
       "7:24 they wanted to do money laundering and\n",
       "7:26 stuff, right? Because I did like graph\n",
       "7:28 theory and those things uh on couple of\n",
       "7:32 projects. So they thought okay maybe\n",
       "7:33 this is suitable and the second option\n",
       "7:36 was going to have the link to the\n",
       "7:38 amusement park. Uh I didn't like the\n",
       "7:42 like duh that's obvious right? Uh I\n",
       "7:46 didn't like the banking so I went to the\n",
       "7:49 second uh choice and at first I was\n",
       "7:53 quite lost. It was like what the hell am\n",
       "7:55 I doing here? How did I end up here?\n",
       "7:57 Right? because my background is like uh\n",
       "8:01 I love technology and technological\n",
       "8:03 companies and like how can I cross over\n",
       "8:07 to that again when I land in Eftilling\n",
       "8:09 right uh so yeah I went there and I\n",
       "8:13 started like trying to understand what\n",
       "8:15 the problem is there that I can really\n",
       "8:17 help right yeah you are going to be\n",
       "8:20 quite shocked when you land there and\n",
       "8:22 you think okay what kind of data that\n",
       "8:25 like an amusement could have amuse ment\n",
       "8:28 park could have that I can like\n",
       "8:30 basically\n",
       "8:32 design a model or train a model on.\n",
       "8:34 Right.\n",
       "8:35 Mhm.\n",
       "8:36 So it started from there. Uh\n",
       "8:40 and yeah the their problem their main\n",
       "8:43 problem was crowd control.\n",
       "8:44 Mhm. Cuz I imagine this is uh like\n",
       "8:47 Disneyland, right? So where you have a\n",
       "8:49 lot of rides\n",
       "8:50 and then for each uh right you need to\n",
       "8:53 stand in the queue and then yeah\n",
       "8:57 basically you wait in the queue until\n",
       "8:59 it's your turn then you go there 5\n",
       "9:01 seconds and then you have to like at\n",
       "9:03 least this is the experience from\n",
       "9:04 Disneyland right so you probably had a\n",
       "9:07 similar problem there right?\n",
       "9:08 Yeah exactly I think you know the\n",
       "9:10 business better than me\n",
       "9:12 because you were on the on the floor so\n",
       "9:16 uh\n",
       "9:18 giving a bit of background about Fing\n",
       "9:20 after is like the biggest uh theme park\n",
       "9:24 in the Netherlands and I think it's\n",
       "9:26 probably in terms of revenue and stuff\n",
       "9:28 it's the second in Europe\n",
       "9:30 okay\n",
       "9:31 maybe the third I don't know maybe after\n",
       "9:33 Europe and Disney\n",
       "9:36 it's the third uh I have to check but\n",
       "9:39 still it's very popular I mean in the\n",
       "9:41 Netherlands or in like the part of\n",
       "9:45 Germany that is close to Netherlands\n",
       "9:46 everybody knows it.\n",
       "9:48 Uh, and it has a lot of stories. The\n",
       "9:51 most important part like the significant\n",
       "9:53 thing about thing is that every ride has\n",
       "9:56 a story. Almost every ride has a story\n",
       "9:58 behind it. So, it's not just like a ride\n",
       "10:01 that you go to to be a scared or like to\n",
       "10:04 like get adrenaline pump and stuff rush.\n",
       "10:07 But like everything has a story behind\n",
       "10:09 it. It's a mine. It's a story about the\n",
       "10:12 mine. It's a roller coaster, but it's a\n",
       "10:13 story about the like a minor that got\n",
       "10:15 stuck there or it got haunted or Yeah.\n",
       "10:18 So, that was the cool part. That was\n",
       "10:20 like the the thing that could trigger me\n",
       "10:23 like, okay, who did who came up with\n",
       "10:26 this idea, right? And\n",
       "10:30 the the most uh interesting thing for me\n",
       "10:33 there or the most impactful for me there\n",
       "10:35 was that I learned that there was a guy\n",
       "10:37 called Peter Rinders\n",
       "10:40 and he was like the mind behind how to\n",
       "10:45 create like these motors and movements\n",
       "10:48 and how put this mechanical stuff\n",
       "10:50 together to bring the magic to life\n",
       "10:52 basically without without showing the\n",
       "10:55 technology actually. uh but it's still\n",
       "10:59 uh presented in a way that is it looks\n",
       "11:02 magical.\n",
       "11:03 Mhm.\n",
       "11:04 I think that was like uh very like I I\n",
       "11:08 found myself a bit I mean I'm not saying\n",
       "11:11 I'm the innovator of the time but he was\n",
       "11:15 like he was the in innovator of he was a\n",
       "11:18 I think a big Dutch innovator and he\n",
       "11:22 basically laid the foundation for all\n",
       "11:24 the innovations that you can see in the\n",
       "11:26 park. For example, uh,\n",
       "11:30 Snow White in in Eterling. If you go\n",
       "11:32 there, you can see she's just laying\n",
       "11:36 there, right? Very subtle. She's just\n",
       "11:38 laying there and every kid is looking at\n",
       "11:41 her behind the window, but she's\n",
       "11:44 breathing.\n",
       "11:46 So, that small thing that she's\n",
       "11:48 breathing, it adds a lot of magic to\n",
       "11:51 like when you look at her behind the\n",
       "11:53 window uh for a kid, right? So yeah,\n",
       "11:57 those like subtle stuff is like really\n",
       "12:00 important. This can be in our job as\n",
       "12:02 well, right? When you're presenting\n",
       "12:04 something or when you have like a the\n",
       "12:06 product, right? They don't need to know\n",
       "12:08 the\n",
       "12:10 the back end or how complicated the back\n",
       "12:12 end is. It just needs to function well.\n",
       "12:15 Mhm. Mhm. Yeah. Uh that's uh the story\n",
       "12:18 of all software engineers, right?\n",
       "12:21 Yeah. Right.\n",
       "12:23 Like you don't need to know how it\n",
       "12:24 works. Yeah.\n",
       "12:26 Uh but what did you do there? Like you\n",
       "12:29 did some uh analytics and data science\n",
       "12:32 and machine learning, right?\n",
       "12:33 Yeah. So the problem was how they can\n",
       "12:36 control the crowd in different places in\n",
       "12:38 the park or how they can drive the um\n",
       "12:43 group of people in different places in\n",
       "12:45 the park because usually people will\n",
       "12:47 rush to the roller coaster area for\n",
       "12:49 example. Uh but there are like the\n",
       "12:52 places that they tell a stories. It's\n",
       "12:54 like there there are places that are\n",
       "12:56 suitable for families or small kids. So\n",
       "12:59 the goal was in in our definition, the\n",
       "13:03 goal was to create a recommendation\n",
       "13:05 system to like basically drive people\n",
       "13:10 uh and plan their day or plan the next\n",
       "13:13 move actually.\n",
       "13:14 Mhm.\n",
       "13:15 In order to\n",
       "13:16 to to avoid long waiting times or\n",
       "13:20 so that was the ultimate goal.\n",
       "13:22 Yeah. Yeah. To have better experience\n",
       "13:24 because I guess if you go to an\n",
       "13:25 amusement park and all you do is spend\n",
       "13:28 time in cues at 10, it's not fun, right?\n",
       "13:31 Yeah. Exactly. Yeah. In order to do that\n",
       "13:34 also we needed to predict\n",
       "13:36 uh how like how long the queue will be,\n",
       "13:40 right? Then you need the capacity of the\n",
       "13:42 ride, right? Mhm.\n",
       "13:44 Or you can also guess how crowded uh the\n",
       "13:49 roundabout or a place in the park will\n",
       "13:53 be by looking at the transactions of a\n",
       "13:56 restaurant a specific a bigger\n",
       "13:58 restaurant there or\n",
       "14:00 a stand that is selling I don't know\n",
       "14:03 drinks right so we had couple of models\n",
       "14:07 one coming from trans transactions and\n",
       "14:09 the other ones coming from uh the rights\n",
       "14:12 and These two will they gave us an index\n",
       "14:16 of how crowded the place is. Then we\n",
       "14:19 could use that in another model that\n",
       "14:21 would uh try to predict and recommend\n",
       "14:26 the next best move\n",
       "14:28 to to each uh group.\n",
       "14:32 Mhm. Is it um\n",
       "14:35 from the user point of view the user\n",
       "14:37 experience do they have an app and they\n",
       "14:38 say okay now go here now go there?\n",
       "14:41 Yeah. So\n",
       "14:42 Uhhuh. Okay. And then this way you can\n",
       "14:43 redistribute the crowd to different\n",
       "14:45 rides so they don't have they don't\n",
       "14:48 stand in one queue.\n",
       "14:50 Yeah. Exactly. Exactly.\n",
       "14:51 Ah that's cool.\n",
       "14:52 Fing has a like a very popular app also.\n",
       "14:55 I think 60% of the people back then at\n",
       "14:58 least uh used the app.\n",
       "15:00 Mhm.\n",
       "15:01 Yeah. Makes sense. Especially if you\n",
       "15:02 advertise it as like hey do you want to\n",
       "15:04 wait less? Don't load our app and\n",
       "15:06 everyone Yeah. We we want to wait less.\n",
       "15:08 Actually we gave another incentive. They\n",
       "15:12 for the start when we wanted to survey\n",
       "15:14 everybody we told them that okay do you\n",
       "15:16 want a free coffee\n",
       "15:18 okay\n",
       "15:19 they you can participate in this survey\n",
       "15:21 so they installed the app and they did\n",
       "15:23 the survey and they got their free\n",
       "15:25 coffee at the start\n",
       "15:27 yeah which what you were describing\n",
       "15:30 reminds me of one of the classes I had\n",
       "15:34 back in my bachelor studies it was a\n",
       "15:36 modeling class and I don't remember the\n",
       "15:38 tools we use I think it was SPSS\n",
       "15:40 modeling modeler or something like this.\n",
       "15:43 So, we would model supermarkets\n",
       "15:46 and in supermarkets you had some people\n",
       "15:49 that were coming at random times to the\n",
       "15:51 cashiers, right? And we wanted to see\n",
       "15:53 what's the most effective way of dealing\n",
       "15:55 with um the customers, right? How can we\n",
       "15:59 process them as effectively as possible?\n",
       "16:01 And we were trying like uh different uh\n",
       "16:06 ways of arranging the cashiers. And what\n",
       "16:09 worked best I remember was one Q for all\n",
       "16:13 the cashiers.\n",
       "16:15 So you have one common queue and then\n",
       "16:17 they split uh uh you know now you go to\n",
       "16:21 uh I don't know cashier number six you\n",
       "16:22 go to cash number eight. So this is in\n",
       "16:25 our modeling what work best. Did you use\n",
       "16:28 a similar system for for that like uh I\n",
       "16:32 imagine it's some sort of person process\n",
       "16:34 that generates uh visitors and you can\n",
       "16:37 emulate all these things or it was\n",
       "16:38 something completely different\n",
       "16:40 actually what we did it was a bit\n",
       "16:43 different uh um so from the survey\n",
       "16:49 uh like 3,000 people participated in it\n",
       "16:53 and uh we got all the moves that they\n",
       "16:58 have during the day.\n",
       "17:00 So like\n",
       "17:00 Oh, that's cool.\n",
       "17:01 Right. And we had like uh maybe like\n",
       "17:07 less than a bit less than 3,000\n",
       "17:10 variations of the routes that people\n",
       "17:13 will take, right? Based on their\n",
       "17:15 preferences, right? If they're group of\n",
       "17:17 two, they could specify in the app. They\n",
       "17:20 could say if they had launch or not. All\n",
       "17:22 those things we knew right about the\n",
       "17:24 group and if they they were like\n",
       "17:25 daredevils or they would just like want\n",
       "17:28 a chill day and stuff. So we had all\n",
       "17:32 these\n",
       "17:33 variations for each group of people and\n",
       "17:37 we just built a model based on that. So\n",
       "17:40 if you gave your preference right uh\n",
       "17:44 whichever lands closer to one of these\n",
       "17:47 variations or aggregation of these\n",
       "17:50 variations uh the model would give you\n",
       "17:53 probability uh for like basically a list\n",
       "17:56 of attractions that you you could take\n",
       "17:59 and what we would show on the app is the\n",
       "18:01 first the highest probability.\n",
       "18:04 So that's cool. I mean it was like\n",
       "18:07 pretty simple right but yeah\n",
       "18:11 yeah it is like many things right\n",
       "18:14 usually the simplest thing works\n",
       "18:16 really good\n",
       "18:18 yeah especially when you want to show it\n",
       "18:20 to like you don't know who is going to\n",
       "18:21 go to the park right it could be like a\n",
       "18:23 15y old or it could be like a 60 year\n",
       "18:25 old that\n",
       "18:26 not so much familiar with the technology\n",
       "18:29 yeah and then you worked at ball so even\n",
       "18:32 so I don't live in the Netherlands but I\n",
       "18:34 know about ball so first of Well, I know\n",
       "18:36 cuz they frequently attend people from\n",
       "18:38 there. They frequently attend Berlin\n",
       "18:40 buzzwords. I don't know if you ever did\n",
       "18:42 this. Uh Berlin buzzwords is a\n",
       "18:45 conference in Berlin about uh uh search\n",
       "18:48 and then other hot topics like machine\n",
       "18:50 learning. Um this year was uh AI but\n",
       "18:54 typically search. So people from B come\n",
       "18:56 to Berlin uh to Berlin buzzwords uh and\n",
       "18:59 like every year there is a talk from\n",
       "19:02 them about some challenges that they\n",
       "19:04 solve. So that's how I know about ball\n",
       "19:07 and I know that this is a big company uh\n",
       "19:09 this is like Dutch Amazon right\n",
       "19:12 u and you like this company they sell\n",
       "19:15 books right and other things\n",
       "19:17 yeah they started exactly like Amazon\n",
       "19:19 selling books but now it's like\n",
       "19:22 everything\n",
       "19:23 yeah and you work there and uh what did\n",
       "19:26 you work on\n",
       "19:28 we so\n",
       "19:31 we I worked specifically on the like\n",
       "19:34 Most of it it was like favorite brand uh\n",
       "19:39 carousel basically that you could see in\n",
       "19:41 the app and the web shop website. Uh\n",
       "19:46 yeah, that was like I think my biggest\n",
       "19:48 uh product there. So you could basically\n",
       "19:52 browse the favorite brands.\n",
       "19:55 uh back back then it was a big push from\n",
       "19:59 uh like the managers to so that we need\n",
       "20:03 to like uh in integrate like the brands\n",
       "20:08 into our websites uh and apps. So that\n",
       "20:14 the algorithm was basically was showing\n",
       "20:16 the what is the favorite brand right now\n",
       "20:18 and uh if it's related to you.\n",
       "20:21 Mhm. And brands is like if I read is it\n",
       "20:24 book related? Let's say if I read books\n",
       "20:26 then my favorite brands would be like\n",
       "20:28 mending and or\n",
       "20:30 kind of yeah but this is everything\n",
       "20:32 right. It could be like I don't know\n",
       "20:34 Nike right\n",
       "20:37 yeah it could be clothing brand or like\n",
       "20:39 book brands or like publisher I mean uh\n",
       "20:42 or anything. Yeah.\n",
       "20:44 So yeah that that was like the biggest\n",
       "20:46 one. Uh\n",
       "20:49 uh but yeah, I did also small stuff like\n",
       "20:51 I just open ball and I see Well, first\n",
       "20:54 of all, everything is in Dutch, but\n",
       "20:56 since I speak German, uh it's kind of\n",
       "20:58 understandable for me. And I see\n",
       "21:01 watches, uh coffee machines, uh wash uh\n",
       "21:05 washing machines, smartphones, uh lamps,\n",
       "21:10 uh furniture, basically everything. So\n",
       "21:13 yeah. Yeah. Yeah, it has everything. the\n",
       "21:16 film stools.\n",
       "21:19 Okay.\n",
       "21:21 So that's why like let's say if we talk\n",
       "21:24 about uh clothes it could be Nikes or\n",
       "21:26 Adidases, right?\n",
       "21:27 Yeah. Exactly. So, it could be more\n",
       "21:30 related to what you purchased before,\n",
       "21:34 but also it has an element of\n",
       "21:37 uh how popular the brand is because you\n",
       "21:40 don't want to maybe you bought like a\n",
       "21:43 screen protector for your phone, right?\n",
       "21:46 But it's not your favorite brand,\n",
       "21:49 although it's popular,\n",
       "21:51 right?\n",
       "21:51 But it's not your favorite. Favorite is\n",
       "21:53 more like this is in the realm of like\n",
       "21:56 more like sociology and those things,\n",
       "21:58 but it's more like you would really\n",
       "22:01 spend money without caring about how\n",
       "22:03 much you spend.\n",
       "22:06 Yeah. Like Apple has a good fan base,\n",
       "22:08 right? Like they\n",
       "22:10 without like thinking, okay, how much\n",
       "22:12 does it\n",
       "22:14 like how much does it cost? And it's\n",
       "22:17 like a perception of value.\n",
       "22:19 Mhm.\n",
       "22:21 Okay. But uh let's say I like Nikes cuz\n",
       "22:24 they are really comfortable. But if Nike\n",
       "22:26 is Nike increases the price, I would be\n",
       "22:29 like, \"Yeah, maybe I check these ones.\"\n",
       "22:32 Like does it mean it's my favorite brand\n",
       "22:34 or not?\n",
       "22:36 Uh I think it then again depends like\n",
       "22:39 when it comes to shoes, I would prefer\n",
       "22:41 having shoes from Nike because uh I know\n",
       "22:43 that when I wear the sneakers, they will\n",
       "22:46 just fit my feet.\n",
       "22:48 Yeah. What what counts as favorite is\n",
       "22:50 like probably you'll check it's like\n",
       "22:53 behavioral also a bit right you'll check\n",
       "22:55 their maybe the trend from Nike right or\n",
       "22:59 you check their latest release right\n",
       "23:03 or you favoriteed them\n",
       "23:06 I don't do any of these things\n",
       "23:08 just any choose and if I need shoes I go\n",
       "23:11 check what kind of models are there\n",
       "23:14 but usually I go with the same model but\n",
       "23:16 what they do and I really hate this they\n",
       "23:19 retire models. So the model I like I\n",
       "23:22 want to buy but it's no longer available\n",
       "23:24 and I'm like okay what do I do now?\n",
       "23:26 Yeah it happens to me as well. Yeah\n",
       "23:29 this is\n",
       "23:31 yeah then but I think Zolando does it\n",
       "23:33 best in that category. It has really\n",
       "23:38 nice uh way of I mean a nice model\n",
       "23:41 probably in the background as well but\n",
       "23:43 also a nice way of showing the similar\n",
       "23:45 products.\n",
       "23:46 Mhm. So I think they are I mean they are\n",
       "23:50 doing really good. I think we also in\n",
       "23:52 bowl had like a similar products u\n",
       "23:57 carousel I think uh but yeah I think\n",
       "24:01 they are doing pretty well in terms of\n",
       "24:03 like exploring the similar products.\n",
       "24:06 Mhm. And uh since you worked in the\n",
       "24:09 recommener systems uh was it something\n",
       "24:12 simple or more complex like neural\n",
       "24:14 networks? I think the biggest challenge\n",
       "24:16 in recommendation systems is how do you\n",
       "24:19 validate it really?\n",
       "24:20 Yeah. Right. AB tests or what was it?\n",
       "24:23 Yeah. Then AB test is also like biased\n",
       "24:26 to how you define the AB test, right?\n",
       "24:28 Uh right. uh the real performance of I\n",
       "24:31 think that's really challenging like how\n",
       "24:33 do you say okay uh you can't say okay\n",
       "24:37 how much did I sell right from the\n",
       "24:40 recommendations that I or how much click\n",
       "24:42 did I get uh from the recommendations\n",
       "24:46 that I showed but uh like then again\n",
       "24:49 what's the experience it was really was\n",
       "24:52 it really like they the things that they\n",
       "24:54 wanted or could have done better so it's\n",
       "24:58 like the validation S is a bit but we\n",
       "25:00 actually one interesting thing about the\n",
       "25:04 favorite brand project was that we\n",
       "25:06 thought about this and we thought okay\n",
       "25:08 how can we test this? So we created\n",
       "25:11 something like uh a swiping game\n",
       "25:15 so we would show this thing the swiping\n",
       "25:19 thing to uh all the employees involved.\n",
       "25:22 Mhm. And that's how actually we tested\n",
       "25:26 the algorithm and we were convinced okay\n",
       "25:29 this is working and then we released it.\n",
       "25:32 Maybe I can share this.\n",
       "25:34 Yeah.\n",
       "25:38 Okay. I hope you can see my screen.\n",
       "25:42 Yeah. But um so we will release this as\n",
       "25:44 audio only. So if you can also describe\n",
       "25:46 what's happening on the screen would be\n",
       "25:48 helpful.\n",
       "25:49 You can see my screen.\n",
       "25:50 Yeah. Yeah. It's loading.\n",
       "25:53 Okay. Yeah, we try to make it also fun\n",
       "25:56 with like adding like Star Wars loading\n",
       "25:58 gifts and all the things. Uh so it won't\n",
       "26:01 be boring. Uh before the employees see\n",
       "26:05 this page uh we did some process like\n",
       "26:09 streaming actually so that because we\n",
       "26:12 didn't want to process like three\n",
       "26:13 million users or six million users. We\n",
       "26:15 just wanted to do it for our employees,\n",
       "26:18 right? Otherwise it would be very\n",
       "26:19 costly. uh and we didn't know which\n",
       "26:23 users are our employees involved, right?\n",
       "26:25 So, we had to do all the calculations on\n",
       "26:27 the fly just before them seeing this\n",
       "26:29 page and it took like 45.\n",
       "26:31 So, the experience for the users was uh\n",
       "26:35 uh they go to the website and if they're\n",
       "26:38 employees then they see this.\n",
       "26:41 It was some website was internal. Yeah.\n",
       "26:44 Okay. Okay. Okay.\n",
       "26:45 Yeah. Yeah. Uh so we did all the process\n",
       "26:48 there and they could easily say okay\n",
       "26:50 this is my favorite band what what\n",
       "26:52 you're showing me is my favorite.\n",
       "26:53 So right now you show can you describe\n",
       "26:56 so\n",
       "26:57 do you want to see stabilo Ubisoft\n",
       "27:00 exactly is is for example on a card we\n",
       "27:04 are having three buttons that says okay\n",
       "27:06 it's not my favorite button I super like\n",
       "27:09 it or it is my favorite uh brand.\n",
       "27:11 It seems very random. So, Stabilo, they\n",
       "27:15 create markers and Tubisoft is a game uh\n",
       "27:19 software company, right?\n",
       "27:21 Yeah.\n",
       "27:22 Syomi is um they produce what? They\n",
       "27:26 produce fonts and variable devices,\n",
       "27:28 right?\n",
       "27:28 Yeah. Yeah. But but I mean your your way\n",
       "27:32 of buying a stuff, you don't buy like\n",
       "27:35 only books from B. You usually buy like\n",
       "27:38 a different uh\n",
       "27:41 variation. But like if I need markers\n",
       "27:43 and I see different ones, I would go\n",
       "27:45 with this stabilo. I don't know how\n",
       "27:47 actually I pronounce it.\n",
       "27:49 Um\n",
       "27:51 cuz I know that they are good. And if\n",
       "27:53 there are some other ones that I don't\n",
       "27:55 know about, I'll just go with these\n",
       "27:56 ones.\n",
       "27:58 Yeah. That basically\n",
       "28:00 it it you want to see what's the\n",
       "28:03 perception about this brand.\n",
       "28:05 Okay. Okay.\n",
       "28:06 Like or do you even know the brand,\n",
       "28:07 right? like if you\n",
       "28:09 I have no idea what is that. What is 999\n",
       "28:11 games?\n",
       "28:12 This is like a board game. Uh\n",
       "28:14 okay. Yeah. I have no idea.\n",
       "28:16 Yeah. I mean like if you're into board\n",
       "28:19 games, you obviously know them. Like if\n",
       "28:21 you like Lego and stuff.\n",
       "28:24 So they would easily swipe right and\n",
       "28:26 left each individual and we could see if\n",
       "28:30 our favorite brand\n",
       "28:32 algorithm works towards them or not.\n",
       "28:34 There is a comment from um Adonis. Hi\n",
       "28:37 Adonis by the way. Uh it looks uh like\n",
       "28:40 Tinder for brands.\n",
       "28:42 Exactly.\n",
       "28:43 I guess we all know where you got the\n",
       "28:46 inspiration from.\n",
       "28:47 Yeah, exactly.\n",
       "28:52 So yeah, that was the\n",
       "28:54 how But how did it So I worked at\n",
       "28:57 something at a similar company. It\n",
       "28:59 wasn't the commerce. It was online\n",
       "29:01 marketplace but the idea is similar. You\n",
       "29:03 have items, you have people to who\n",
       "29:06 recommend these items and then you let's\n",
       "29:09 say you develop a uh recommendation\n",
       "29:12 system, recommener system and then you\n",
       "29:15 already have some basic recommener and\n",
       "29:17 then you improve uh the recommener and\n",
       "29:20 then you split your groups into you your\n",
       "29:22 visitors your traffic into two groups.\n",
       "29:25 One is test group, another is control\n",
       "29:26 group, right? So uh the control group\n",
       "29:29 sees the new algorithm, the test group\n",
       "29:31 sees the old algorithm and then you\n",
       "29:33 check metrics like in our case the\n",
       "29:35 metric was how many um so we wanted to\n",
       "29:39 improve conversion of course right and\n",
       "29:42 for that uh company the conversion meant\n",
       "29:45 that people write each other so let's\n",
       "29:47 say it's like uh mark plots I think in\n",
       "29:51 the Netherlands so\n",
       "29:53 so you want to buy I don't know this\n",
       "29:56 loudspeaker\n",
       "29:58 So you write to the person who is um\n",
       "30:00 selling it right. So that's the\n",
       "30:02 conversion they're writing thing. Um and\n",
       "30:05 then we would just measure okay like in\n",
       "30:07 the test group uh we saw uh in the test\n",
       "30:11 group we saw more uh than in the control\n",
       "30:13 group right more conversions and then it\n",
       "30:16 means that this algorithm is good so we\n",
       "30:18 can roll it out. So I I guess this is\n",
       "30:20 the basic uh AB test. But why did you\n",
       "30:23 need to do this Tinder for brands? Like\n",
       "30:26 what's the point? Why you couldn't do\n",
       "30:28 the usual way?\n",
       "30:31 The the the other there was nothing\n",
       "30:35 similar to this like there was nothing\n",
       "30:37 before this.\n",
       "30:38 Okay.\n",
       "30:39 So your control group would be nothing\n",
       "30:41 and test group would be this thing.\n",
       "30:43 Yeah. Basically\n",
       "30:45 or we could we could have also done the\n",
       "30:46 same. We would have just like maybe\n",
       "30:49 aggregated the purchases on a brand or\n",
       "30:51 views on a brand and show the random\n",
       "30:55 items right from those brands and then\n",
       "30:57 test it with this one right that could\n",
       "30:59 have also been done. Uh but this is was\n",
       "31:02 just like convincing our team that this\n",
       "31:05 can work.\n",
       "31:06 Uhhuh. Makes sense. So it's like to have\n",
       "31:08 an internal\n",
       "31:10 um agreement that okay this is actually\n",
       "31:13 worth our time. Let's spend a quarter\n",
       "31:16 developing this idea further, right?\n",
       "31:18 Exactly. Yeah.\n",
       "31:19 Okay. Makes sense.\n",
       "31:20 Yeah. Three, two, three months.\n",
       "31:22 Yeah. Okay. Like how and how did you use\n",
       "31:25 the results? Like how was it actually\n",
       "31:28 helping with your case?\n",
       "31:30 Cuz it's fun. Yeah. But like at the end\n",
       "31:32 you swiped left and right and what was\n",
       "31:34 the outcome?\n",
       "31:35 Uh basically we used how accurate we\n",
       "31:39 were actually in uh showing the brands.\n",
       "31:43 So I think what we did was also couple\n",
       "31:46 of the items in that list was not\n",
       "31:48 actually their favorite brand. So we\n",
       "31:51 could at the end say okay I don't know\n",
       "31:53 85% of the items that they swiped was\n",
       "31:57 actually their like favorite brand.\n",
       "31:59 I see understand. So this thing you\n",
       "32:02 already knew from your algorithm. So you\n",
       "32:04 had the output of the algorithm and the\n",
       "32:06 algorithm says okay like for this person\n",
       "32:08 they like Lego, they like Komi, they\n",
       "32:12 like Nike, right? But then in addition\n",
       "32:14 to this you add three more brands that\n",
       "32:17 that are not in the output of the\n",
       "32:19 algorithm and ideally they would swipe I\n",
       "32:23 don't remember this like they would like\n",
       "32:26 uh the onesh that the algorithm\n",
       "32:29 recommended and they would dislike the\n",
       "32:31 ones that it didn't recommend. Yeah.\n",
       "32:33 Yeah. Yeah.\n",
       "32:34 Oh, that's cool.\n",
       "32:35 Yeah. So, that's how we found out, okay,\n",
       "32:37 this is going to basically a way to\n",
       "32:40 validate it again, the model again to be\n",
       "32:43 able to release it for like something\n",
       "32:45 that didn't wasn't uh there in the first\n",
       "32:49 place.\n",
       "32:49 Okay. And then uh what the user they see\n",
       "32:52 a brand, they click and they can buy\n",
       "32:54 stuff from this brand, right?\n",
       "32:56 Yeah. Exactly. So the\n",
       "32:58 the the purpose of this uh component was\n",
       "33:02 that they click on the brand and they\n",
       "33:05 see a list of uh featured or popular\n",
       "33:08 product from that brand.\n",
       "33:11 Okay.\n",
       "33:12 And then the engagement on the brands\n",
       "33:15 will go higher in B. That was like the\n",
       "33:17 thing kind.\n",
       "33:19 What what do you know? What do you do\n",
       "33:21 now?\n",
       "33:22 Uh currently\n",
       "33:24 yeah.\n",
       "33:24 Oh yeah. So yeah, I work as a basically\n",
       "33:27 a data engineer in Tesla.\n",
       "33:30 Yeah.\n",
       "33:32 Sorry. Um at B you worked as ML engineer\n",
       "33:35 or was a data data engineer.\n",
       "33:38 So I did like both actually. I did data\n",
       "33:42 science plus data engineering.\n",
       "33:45 So yeah I I when I go there it's like\n",
       "33:48 okay we have this project I'm also\n",
       "33:51 interested to work on it. That's it. Uh\n",
       "33:55 I think that's also a mix that is coming\n",
       "33:58 from my background because I'm I'm like\n",
       "34:00 you never transition to you can say okay\n",
       "34:03 I'm data scientist now right\n",
       "34:05 you have you carry your background with\n",
       "34:07 you right you you have a software\n",
       "34:08 engineer background\n",
       "34:09 that's the story of my life\n",
       "34:11 yeah exactly right so either you want it\n",
       "34:14 or not you want to like you have some\n",
       "34:17 interest from your previous background\n",
       "34:19 right you you try to involve that so\n",
       "34:21 that was always uh same for me like in\n",
       "34:24 link and the app that did we did the\n",
       "34:27 survey I wrote the Android app I was\n",
       "34:30 data scientist there right but that\n",
       "34:33 helped the data collection so um you try\n",
       "34:37 to pick those tasks up in the same uh um\n",
       "34:43 like I'm interested in machine learning\n",
       "34:45 so I like deploying I like training the\n",
       "34:48 the models so if I see that uh it can\n",
       "34:52 really help And that's that's another\n",
       "34:54 thing, right? You really to need to\n",
       "34:57 understand if it it is going to help or\n",
       "35:00 not or you're just making it complicated\n",
       "35:02 for nothing. Uh\n",
       "35:05 yeah, if it helps, I I'll try to do that\n",
       "35:08 as well.\n",
       "35:09 Mhm.\n",
       "35:10 Okay. And uh\n",
       "35:12 is mixing like the roles and stuff.\n",
       "35:16 But the idea is even though you're a\n",
       "35:18 data engineer, you can do pretty much\n",
       "35:20 everything that needs to be done.\n",
       "35:24 Yeah. So in Tesla especially that's the\n",
       "35:26 case. I mean it's pretty hands-on and\n",
       "35:30 you just like you need to create some\n",
       "35:32 stuff that are functional and you don't\n",
       "35:35 think about making it fancy. Uh\n",
       "35:40 I think maybe in other software\n",
       "35:41 companies it's a bit different but yeah\n",
       "35:44 I want to also state that I'm not at all\n",
       "35:47 talking on behalf of Tesla.\n",
       "35:50 Yeah that's important. But can you\n",
       "35:52 actually talk about the things you do at\n",
       "35:54 work?\n",
       "35:55 Not so much to be honest. The Yeah, I\n",
       "35:58 can take generally about like who am I\n",
       "36:03 and what's my background is but the\n",
       "36:04 projects in Tesla I cannot really talk\n",
       "36:06 about\n",
       "36:08 detail. Yeah.\n",
       "36:09 Yeah. But u what is interesting from\n",
       "36:12 what you described is the combination of\n",
       "36:15 skills you have. So and for me it was\n",
       "36:18 pretty similar. So actually a story I\n",
       "36:22 don't know maybe you can relate my first\n",
       "36:24 job as a data scientist I got hired\n",
       "36:26 because I knew Java right and so I was a\n",
       "36:29 software engineer I was working with\n",
       "36:31 Java and when I started when I already\n",
       "36:34 did my masters and I already graduated\n",
       "36:37 the first job they were only interested\n",
       "36:39 in my Java skills they say yeah like we\n",
       "36:41 have this data scientists but they\n",
       "36:43 create code in R and Python and they\n",
       "36:46 don't want to uh touch any Java. So we\n",
       "36:49 know we need somebody who knows Java and\n",
       "36:51 I'm like okay whatever.\n",
       "36:54 Yeah that's that that's exactly how it\n",
       "36:56 is I think. I mean um yeah I don't know\n",
       "37:00 it's like every everything that is\n",
       "37:03 sometimes\n",
       "37:04 when the like the fields are advancing\n",
       "37:08 it diverges right like at first it's\n",
       "37:12 software engineering right then it\n",
       "37:13 becomes back end front end I don't know\n",
       "37:15 DevOps right all those things it\n",
       "37:18 diverges but at some point it also\n",
       "37:20 converges again like it comes back\n",
       "37:22 together like a data scientist okay you\n",
       "37:24 need to now if they need like uh I don't\n",
       "37:27 know even what it's going to be called\n",
       "37:29 but if you don't know deployment right\n",
       "37:32 or you just know some stat statistical\n",
       "37:36 methods uh you cannot transform the data\n",
       "37:39 is that so data scientist or you need to\n",
       "37:42 know all of these all together right\n",
       "37:46 but how would you call so when I ask you\n",
       "37:49 what you do now you said I'm a data\n",
       "37:51 engineer so you would identify yourself\n",
       "37:53 as uh like with data engineering or you\n",
       "37:56 would say I'm like a\n",
       "37:59 generalist.\n",
       "38:01 Uh\n",
       "38:02 I think what I'm good at is at uh being\n",
       "38:06 a machine learning engineer.\n",
       "38:09 My day-to-day tasks maybe is like 60%\n",
       "38:12 70% data engineering and the the last\n",
       "38:16 30% is like software engineering,\n",
       "38:18 machine learning engineering, all those\n",
       "38:19 things or data scientists.\n",
       "38:23 So yeah it depends on what my employer\n",
       "38:26 wants to be honest.\n",
       "38:27 I understand. Uh so is it uh\n",
       "38:31 but is it so for me when I was a data\n",
       "38:35 scientist the uh problem and problem for\n",
       "38:39 companies and uh I guess an opportunity\n",
       "38:42 for me was that data scientists they\n",
       "38:45 weren't good at deploying models\n",
       "38:47 and they actually didn't want to do this\n",
       "38:49 and because of my background it was not\n",
       "38:51 that difficult to like I for example I\n",
       "38:55 didn't know Kubernetes\n",
       "38:57 uh before my previous job and then I\n",
       "38:59 joined the company and they are like uh\n",
       "39:02 yeah we need we have now this model we\n",
       "39:05 have this Kubernetes cluster and the\n",
       "39:07 SRES the people who are looking after\n",
       "39:09 the cluster they are super busy so we\n",
       "39:11 cannot get their time to deploy the\n",
       "39:13 models and then like okay like how can\n",
       "39:15 it be difficult let's uh figure this out\n",
       "39:19 um\n",
       "39:20 but sometimes it's not always possible\n",
       "39:24 right for data scientists to just go\n",
       "39:26 ahead and do this Um,\n",
       "39:29 so and you said like you do whatever\n",
       "39:31 your employer wants you to do. I I'm\n",
       "39:34 just wondering how how does it work in\n",
       "39:36 practice cuz there are some things you\n",
       "39:38 want to do but maybe cannot. There are\n",
       "39:40 things you want to do or maybe there are\n",
       "39:42 some things you don't want to do but you\n",
       "39:44 need to do like how do you find the\n",
       "39:46 balance? How do you actually uh go out\n",
       "39:48 of this um uh\n",
       "39:53 I don't know how do you even prove\n",
       "39:54 yourself that okay like yes I am a ML\n",
       "39:57 junior but I can do these other things\n",
       "40:00 and then you prove yourself and then you\n",
       "40:02 get more and more responsibilities.\n",
       "40:05 Yeah. So yeah that's a good question. I\n",
       "40:07 mean I don't probably know the exact\n",
       "40:09 answer but uh\n",
       "40:13 yeah sometimes you need to get yourself\n",
       "40:14 out of the trap right? It's like, oh, I\n",
       "40:17 don't need to do this, right? I don't\n",
       "40:18 need to fix this dashboard for you or uh\n",
       "40:23 but I think it's all about like, yeah,\n",
       "40:26 it's opportunity, right? Uh you find\n",
       "40:29 something that oh yeah, this when they\n",
       "40:32 the other people cannot see that, right?\n",
       "40:34 See the opportunity and you see the\n",
       "40:35 opportunity, you're obliged to take it,\n",
       "40:38 right? you can take it or you can do\n",
       "40:41 just do the standard uh maybe the\n",
       "40:45 problem is solved with a script right\n",
       "40:47 not with a like a training a model but\n",
       "40:50 if you think that training a model works\n",
       "40:52 better why not so that's that's how it\n",
       "40:55 works currently for me so if I see that\n",
       "40:58 okay there is opportunity that it can\n",
       "41:00 improve it exponentially right uh I try\n",
       "41:05 to do it uh I mean obviously there are\n",
       "41:08 some bound boundaries, right? You you\n",
       "41:10 look at your like how much time do I\n",
       "41:13 have to work on it and but it's all\n",
       "41:15 about being uh like underpromising and\n",
       "41:19 overd delivering most of the time. So,\n",
       "41:22 okay, that's a good approach, right?\n",
       "41:25 Because if you overpromise and underdel,\n",
       "41:27 it's way worse.\n",
       "41:28 That's that's way worse. But it takes a\n",
       "41:30 lot of effort, right? It takes a lot of\n",
       "41:32 energy from you.\n",
       "41:35 Yeah.\n",
       "41:36 And uh\n",
       "41:39 so you you're still doing some machine\n",
       "41:40 learning right?\n",
       "41:41 Yes.\n",
       "41:43 And u always engage myself with that and\n",
       "41:46 yeah now with like LM agents and all\n",
       "41:50 those things that are being used across\n",
       "41:52 all the companies including Tesla. It's\n",
       "41:55 like a really like nice opportunity to\n",
       "42:00 uh improve your task as well as the\n",
       "42:02 platforms that you're providing for\n",
       "42:05 others uh other colleagues. Yeah, it's\n",
       "42:08 great. I think it's a great time to be\n",
       "42:11 and you been in the industry for quite\n",
       "42:14 some time. So you also saw this uh race\n",
       "42:18 of LLMs and AI in the recent years. Um,\n",
       "42:22 how did your work change with that? Cuz\n",
       "42:25 I guess now the challenges are a little\n",
       "42:27 different. The models we deploy,\n",
       "42:29 especially when it comes to LMS, they\n",
       "42:31 come with their own set of challenges.\n",
       "42:33 So, what are these challenges for you\n",
       "42:34 and how do you deal with them?\n",
       "42:37 I think uh first it drastically changes\n",
       "42:43 sometimes. Like also I'm shocked like\n",
       "42:46 wow this this this might have t taken me\n",
       "42:49 like 4 days but now I can just solve\n",
       "42:52 this in like couple of hours right\n",
       "42:55 especially for developers I think that's\n",
       "42:57 that's amazing the other pitfall that it\n",
       "42:59 has is actually everybody thinking that\n",
       "43:02 oh yeah AI can solve this\n",
       "43:05 right\n",
       "43:05 but are you talking about using AI for\n",
       "43:09 creating code or you're talking about\n",
       "43:11 using the models for actually solving\n",
       "43:13 this problems.\n",
       "43:15 I think mostly about creating code.\n",
       "43:17 Uh-huh. Okay. So like W coding or create\n",
       "43:20 Oh, the the correct way of doing of\n",
       "43:22 saying is AI assisted development,\n",
       "43:24 right?\n",
       "43:25 Yeah. W coding and also I like web\n",
       "43:28 coding more.\n",
       "43:29 Yeah. W coding means that you just uh\n",
       "43:32 you know you leave only once uh and uh\n",
       "43:35 you know whatever code is produced you\n",
       "43:36 shipped.\n",
       "43:37 Okay.\n",
       "43:37 And then sometimes it drops your\n",
       "43:39 database and you're like oops.\n",
       "43:41 Not that. Not that. Uh so then AI\n",
       "43:44 assisted development.\n",
       "43:46 At least this is how I understand the\n",
       "43:47 term.\n",
       "43:48 Okay.\n",

       "43:56 Yeah. True. I think that's true. Yeah.\n",
       "43:58 But I mean in the sense of it can help\n",
       "44:00 you develop code and also like refactor\n",

       "44:33 u um\n",
       "44:36 editing like writing texts um and this\n",

       "46:32 hypothetically\n",
       "46:34 um because you work with LLMs um and now\n",
       "46:38 when we uh self-host an LLM it comes up\n",
       "46:42 with a lot of different challenges right\n",
       "46:45 um cuz previously I would just I don't\n",
       "46:47 know put my scikitlearn in a docker\n",

       "46:51 it's done right but now I cannot do this\n",

       "47:09 Yeah, for inference I think yeah uh I I\n",
       "47:13 like on the weekend and stuff I work\n",
       "47:15 like on these projects. Uh the VLM thing\n",
       "47:20 they think pretty optimized for\n",
       "47:22 inference. you can just get a Raspberry\n",
       "47:24 Pi and\n",
       "47:26 like do inference. uh I mean it's very\n",
       "47:29 slow but now I saw that uh Nvidia Orian\n",
       "47:33 I think uh I think it's called Nvidia\n",
       "47:35 Orian plus or something that is released\n",
       "47:37 by Nvidia that is uh yeah for inference\n",
       "47:41 it's a good inference machine uh it's\n",
       "47:44 like a dev kit or even the Mac minis uh\n",
       "47:47 I think they are amazing actually\n",
       "47:50 they're like yeah amazing for they also\n",
       "47:55 there are some projects that they\n",
       "47:56 cluster all together and uh they are\n",
       "48:00 having like a really good speed on\n",
       "48:03 token per second like a lot of yeah it's\n",
       "48:07 it's it's doing well actually I think\n",
       "48:09 it's going to be\n",
       "48:11 way easier maybe in the future it can be\n",
       "48:13 like the hardware is going to catch up\n",
       "48:15 right it's all about the architecture on\n",
       "48:18 on the hardware side as well so\n",
       "48:21 yeah I checked this Nvidia Jetson Orin\n",
       "48:25 it cost 2,000 A little more expensive\n",
       "48:28 than Raspberry Pi.\n",
       "48:31 Is it? I thought it's like 700.\n",
       "48:33 No, no, no. There is another one. So, I\n",
       "48:35 see um Jetson Nano Orin which has\n",
       "48:38 instead of uh 64 gigs, it has only eight\n",
       "48:41 which costs like 350. Yeah, it's\n",
       "48:44 cheaper.\n",
       "48:45 That's still more expensive than\n",
       "48:47 Raspberry Pi. And like when you said you\n",
       "48:49 were deploying LLMs on Raspberry Pi, I\n",
       "48:51 was like, \"Wow, can you tell us more\n",
       "48:53 about that?\"\n",
       "48:55 But that's that's going to be like\n",
       "48:57 imagine you have a group of people like\n",
       "49:00 five software developers, right? And\n",
       "49:03 they are in a team. You don't want to\n",
       "49:05 pay\n",
       "49:06 €200 per month, right?\n",
       "49:09 Uh you just deploy one model on a like\n",
       "49:12 two Nvidia orients, right? Or one Nvidia\n",
       "49:15 Orient and they just like maybe\n",
       "49:19 sometimes they want to query it, right?\n",
       "49:21 They want to ask some questions. Why\n",
       "49:23 not? But it works, right?\n",
       "49:25 Yeah, cuz it has 8 gigs and this is\n",
       "49:28 enough for a reasonably sized LLM,\n",
       "49:31 right? Cuz especially these days we have\n",
       "49:33 this um\n",
       "49:36 Chinese LLMs that are pretty small\n",
       "49:38 that should fit 8 gigs, right?\n",
       "49:41 Yeah. Also like more like a specialized\n",
       "49:43 model that is just for coding. So you\n",
       "49:46 can just put it in there and they all\n",
       "49:48 the questions are for coding. So I think\n",
       "49:51 it's going to bring the cost down like\n",
       "49:53 for a startup for example.\n",
       "49:55 Yeah. Do do you know any models like\n",
       "49:57 that?\n",
       "49:59 I think 2.7 billion parameter from LMO\n",
       "50:02 is working well. I mean there are other\n",
       "50:04 ones like Gro and stuff uh like cloud is\n",
       "50:07 amazing but yeah uh open source ones I\n",
       "50:11 think LMO.\n",
       "50:12 Okay. And do you do you need to do any\n",
       "50:15 like I'm specifically interested in your\n",
       "50:17 comment that you have specialized models\n",
       "50:19 for code but if you just take lama this\n",
       "50:23 2.7 billion parameters uh it's not\n",
       "50:26 specialized for code so you need to to\n",
       "50:28 do some sort of fine tuning right do you\n",
       "50:30 know if there are any models that are\n",
       "50:32 available already that are already\n",
       "50:35 fine-tuned\n",
       "50:36 uh for coding\n",
       "50:38 I think uh I think Gemini these these\n",
       "50:42 models all I think have uh not all but\n",
       "50:45 some of them have version for code. So I\n",
       "50:49 think Gemini also has it. I think\n",
       "50:50 replicate is the best place right? You\n",
       "50:53 can just go there and see the model and\n",
       "50:56 yeah you can\n",
       "50:57 how do you say replicate\n",
       "50:59 replicate? Yeah.\n",
       "51:00 What's that?\n",
       "51:01 It's it's my favorite website right now.\n",
       "51:03 I mean\n",
       "51:04 replicate.com.\n",
       "51:06 Yeah.\n",
       "51:07 Run AI with an API.\n",
       "51:09 Yeah. They basically they host\n",
       "51:11 everything and you can test the model.\n",
       "51:14 You can get an API from it and they have\n",
       "51:17 a price uh for every request that you\n",
       "51:19 send or every couple of requests that\n",
       "51:20 you send and they charge you like that\n",
       "51:24 and they have like like a big range of\n",
       "51:27 models like for videos for photos.\n",
       "51:32 Yeah, I see that this is quite\n",
       "51:34 interesting. Okay, I am adding it to my\n",
       "51:37 bookmarks.\n",
       "51:39 This probably gonna end up in a lot of\n",
       "51:42 ideas for application for you.\n",
       "51:45 Yeah, maybe. Ah, so I see some questions\n",
       "51:49 um from Adonis. Uh, amazing to hear your\n",
       "51:52 story, Abuzar. What factors do you\n",
       "51:53 believe had the greatest impact on\n",
       "51:55 advancing your career?\n",
       "51:58 Okay.\n",

       "52:09 Uh\n",
       "52:12 um I think\n",
       "52:14 yeah just I I think yeah just finding\n",
       "52:18 like the north star like right what they\n",
       "52:20 call it. I I think I I really liked like\n",
       "52:24 working for Tesla to be honest. Like\n",
       "52:27 uh a company that has a vision, right?\n",
       "52:31 Coming from up to down and that vision\n",
       "52:34 drives the whole technology and and the\n",
       "52:38 business. So I love that about a\n",
       "52:40 company. So if there is a great vision,\n",
       "52:43 I think in a company it will drive\n",
       "52:45 everything like how I think Steve Jobs\n",
       "52:47 was right in Apple, right? So it's like\n",
       "52:50 nice to hear the goals right it looks\n",
       "52:54 impossible it sounds impossible but\n",
       "52:57 somebody is believing in it so it\n",
       "52:59 carries everybody it carries the whole\n",

       "53:10 where there is this great vision and\n",
       "53:13 people are motivated to actually\n",
       "53:17 um go there and do these things even\n",
       "53:20 though they might sound impossible.\n",
       "53:23 Yeah. Exactly. So\n",
       "53:25 yeah also I think that you have to also\n",
       "53:28 think about okay I mean at this point of\n",
       "53:31 life that I am I think mostly I think\n",
       "53:34 okay how much impact like uh I can have\n",
       "53:38 right uh and like which companies are\n",
       "53:42 more aligned to the impacts that I can\n",
       "53:44 have. Maybe when I was younger, I just\n",
       "53:46 wanted to sit in a room and just code\n",
       "53:49 247, right?\n",
       "53:51 But now you also look at, okay, who am I\n",
       "53:54 going to impact? How much impact do I\n",
       "53:57 have? And where can I find that job and\n",
       "54:01 or it's most aligned to to those to\n",
       "54:03 those goals that I have. So yeah, that\n",

       "54:38 uh their experience interviewing the\n",
       "54:40 company. that plus I read I read like a\n",
       "54:46 list of everything back then there was\n",
       "54:49 like I think not a big like it wasn't\n",
       "54:52 actually I think open AI didn't release\n",
       "54:54 actually the chat yet so I couldn't ask\n",
       "54:56 questions okay give me all the questions\n",
       "54:58 that are probable to be asked for like a\n",
       "55:01 data engineering job right uh that was\n",

       "55:21 what's an example of this system what is\n",
       "55:23 actually a distributed system what is\n",
       "55:25 currently used in the companies\n",
       "55:29 regarding that so\n",
       "55:31 yeah that's how I prepared\n",
       "55:33 I just did exactly what you said I asked\n",
       "55:36 GPT give me questions ask Tesla for data\n",
       "55:38 engineering candidates and you gave me a\n",
       "55:41 Well, you didn't have charg back then,\n",
       "55:44 but uh where was it actually? For how\n",
       "55:47 long have you been working at Tesla?\n",
       "55:49 I think it's almost two years. Two\n",

       "56:14 did you need to grind through lead code\n",
       "56:16 to be able to clear the interview?\n",
       "56:18 Not that much actually. No, not code.\n",
       "56:21 Yeah, I think that's more specific to\n",
       "56:22 Google, right?\n",
       "56:24 Okay.\n",
       "56:25 But not this. Yeah.\n",

       "56:31 things.\n",
       "56:32 Yeah. Yeah. Mostly like architecture\n",

       "57:06 see it right now it's one of the\n",
       "57:07 questions\n",
       "57:09 and that uh charg suggested like how\n",

       "57:13 system including data ingestion storage\n",
       "57:15 and pipelines you don't need to comment\n",
