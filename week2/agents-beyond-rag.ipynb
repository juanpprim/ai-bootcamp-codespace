Evaluate responses based on custom criteria, which helps evaluate new outputs when there\\'s no reference available.\\\\n\\\\nWe will focus on demonstrating **how to create and tune the LLM evaluator**, which you can then apply in different contexts, like regression testing or prompt comparison.\\\\n\\\\n<Info>\\\\n**Prefer videos?** We also have an extended code tutorial where we iteratively improve the prompt for LLM judge with a video walkthrough:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kP_aaFnXLmY\\\\n</Info>\\\\n\\\\n## Tutorial scope\\\\n\\\\nHere\\'s what we\\'ll do:\\\\n\\\\n- **Create an evaluation dataset**. Create a toy Q&A dataset.\\\\n- **Create and run an LLM as a judge**. Design an LLM evaluator prompt.\\\\n- **Evaluate the judge**. Compare the LLM judge\\'s evaluations with manual labels.\\\\n\\\\nWe\\'ll start with the reference-based evaluator that determines whether a new response is correct (it\\'s more complex since it requires passing two columns to the prompt). Then, we\\'ll create a simpler judge focused on verbosity.\\\\n\\\\nTo complete the tutorial, you will need:\\\\n\\\\n- Basic Python knowledge.\\\\n- An OpenAI API key to use for the LLM evaluator.\\\\n\\\\nWe recommend running this tutorial in Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab to render rich HTML objects with summary results directly in a notebook cell.\\\\n\\\\n<Info>\\\\n  Run a sample notebook: [Jupyter notebook](https://github.com/evidentlyai/community-examples/blob/main/tutorials/LLM_as_a_judge_tutorial_updated.ipynb) or [open it in Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/github/evidentlyai/community-examples/blob/main/tutorials/LLM_as_a_judge_tutorial_updated.ipynb).\\\\n</Info>\\\\n\\\\n## 1.

Create the Dataset\\\\n\\\\nFirst, we\\'ll create a toy Q&A dataset with customer support question that includes:\\\\n\\\\n- **Questions**. The inputs sent to the LLM app.\\\\n- **Target responses**. The approved responses you consider accurate.\\\\n- **New responses**. Imitated new responses from the system.\\\\n- **Manual labels with explanation**. Labels that say if response is correct or not.\\\\n\\\\nWhy add the labels? It\\'s a good idea to be the judge yourself before you write a prompt. This helps:\\\\n\\\\n- Formulate better criteria. You discover nuances that help you write a better prompt.\\\\n- Get the \\\\\"ground truth\\\\\". You can use it to evaluate the quality of the LLM judge.\\\\n\\\\nUltimately, an LLM judge is a small ML system, and it needs its own evals\\\\\\\\!\\\\n\\\\n**Generate the dataframe**.

Correctness evaluator\\\\n\\\\nNow it\\'s time to set up an LLM judge! We\\'ll start with an evaluator that checks if responses are correct compared to the reference. The goal is to match the quality of our manual labels.\\\\n\\\\n**Configure the evaluator prompt**. We\\'ll use the LLMEval [Descriptor](/docs/library/descriptors) to create a custom binary evaluator. Here\\'s how to define the prompt template for correctness:\\\\n\\\\n```python\\\\ncorrectness = BinaryClassificationPromptTemplate(\\\\n        criteria = \\\\\"\\\\\"\\\\\"An ANSWER is correct when it is the same as the REFERENCE in all facts and details, even if worded differently.\\\\n        The ANSWER is incorrect if it contradicts the REFERENCE, adds additional claims, omits or changes details.\\\\n        REFERENCE:\\\\n        =====\\\\n        {target_response}\\\\n        =====\\\\\"\\\\\"\\\\\",\\\\n        target_category=\\\\\"incorrect\\\\\",\\\\n        non_target_category=\\\\\"correct\\\\\",\\\\n        uncertainty=\\\\\"unknown\\\\\",\\\\n        include_reasoning=True,\\\\n        pre_messages=[(\\\\\"system\\\\\", \\\\\"You are an expert evaluator. You will be given an ANSWER and REFERENCE\\\\\")],\\\\n        )\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\n<Info>\\\\n  The **Binary Classification** template (check [docs](/metrics/customize_llm_judge)) instructs an LLM to classify the input into two classes and add reasoning. You don\\'t need to ask for these details explicitly, or worry about parsing the output structure \\\\u2014 that\\'s built into the template. You only need to add the criteria. You can also use a multi-class template.\\\\n</Info>\\\\n\\\\nIn this example, we\\'ve set up the prompt to be strict (\\\\\"all fact and details\\\\\"). You can write it differently. This flexibility is one of the key benefits of creating a custom judge.\\\\n\\\\n**Score your data**. To add this new descriptor to your dataset, run:\\\\n\\\\n```python\\\\neval_dataset.add_descriptors(descriptors=[\\\\n    LLMEval(\\\\\"new_response\\\\\",\\\\n            template=correctness,\\\\n            provider = \\\\\"openai\\\\\",\\\\n            model = \\\\\"gpt-4o-mini\\\\\",\\\\n            alias=\\\\\"Correctness\\\\\",\\\\n            additional_columns={\\\\\"target_response\\\\\": \\\\\"target_response\\\\\"}),\\\\n    ])\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\n**Preview the results**. You can view the scored dataset in Python. This will show a DataFrame with newly added scores and explanations.\\\\n\\\\n```python\\\\neval_dataset.as_dataframe()\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\n![](/images/examples/llm_judge_tutorial_judge_scored_data-min.png)\\\\n\\\\n<Info>\\\\n  **Note**: your explanations will vary since LLMs are non-deterministic.\\\\n</Info>\\\\n\\\\nIf you want, you can also add the column that will help you easily sort and find all error where the LLM-judged label is different from the ground truth label.\\\\n\\\\n```python\\\\neval_dataset.add_descriptors(descriptors=[\\\\n    ExactMatch(columns=[\\\\\"label\\\\\", \\\\\"Correctness\\\\\"], alias=\\\\\"Judge_match\\\\\")])\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\n**Get a Report.** Summarize the result by generating an Evidently Report.\\\\n\\\\n```python\\\\nreport = Report([\\\\n    TextEvals()\\\\n])\\\\n\\\\nmy_eval = report.run(eval_dataset, None)\\\\nmy_eval\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\nThis will render an HTML report in the notebook cell. You can use other [export options](/docs/library/output_formats), like `as_dict()` for a Python dictionary output.\\\\n\\\\n![](/images/examples/llm_judge_tutorial_report-min.png)\\\\n\\\\nSince we already performed exact matching, you can see the crude accuracy of our judge. However, accuracy is not always the best metric. In this case, we might be more interested in recall: we want to make sure that the judge does not miss any \\\\\"incorrect\\\\\" answers .\\\\n\\\\n## 4. Evaluate the LLM Eval quality\\\\n\\\\nThis part is a bit meta: we\\'re going to evaluate the quality of our LLM evaluator itself\\\\\\\\! We can treat it as a simple **binary classification** problem.\\\\n\\\\n**Data definition**. To evaluate the classification quality, we need to map the structure of the dataset accordingly first. The column with the manual label is the \\\\\"target\\\\\", and the LLM-judge response is the \\\\\"prediction\\\\\":\\\\n\\\\n```python\\\\ndf=eval_dataset.as_dataframe()\\\\n\\\\ndefinition_2 = DataDefinition(\\\\n    classification=[BinaryClassification(\\\\n        target=\\\\\"label\\\\\",\\\\n        prediction_labels=\\\\\"Correctness\\\\\",\\\\n        pos_label = \\\\\"incorrect\\\\\")],\\\\n    categorical_columns=[\\\\\"label\\\\\", \\\\\"Correctness\\\\\"])\\\\n\\\\nclass_dataset = Dataset.from_pandas(\\\\n    pd.DataFrame(df),\\\\n    data_definition=definition_2)\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\n<Info>\\\\n  `Pos_label` refers to the class that is treated as the target (\\\\\"what we want to predict better\\\\\") for metrics like precision, recall, F1-score.\\\\n</Info>\\\\n\\\\n**Get a Report**. Let\\'s use a`ClassificationPreset()` that combines several classification metrics:\\\\n\\\\n```python\\\\nreport = Report([\\\\n    ClassificationPreset()\\\\n])\\\\n\\\\nmy_eval = report.run(class_dataset, None)\\\\nmy_eval\\\\n\\\\n# or my_eval.as_dict()\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\nWe can now get a well-rounded evaluation and explore the confusion matrix. We have one type of error each: overall the results are pretty good\\\\\\\\! You can also refine the prompt to try to improve them.\\\\n\\\\n![](/images/examples/llm_judge_tutorial_conf_matrix-min.png)\\\\n\\\\n## 5. Verbosity evaluator\\\\n\\\\nNext, let\\\\u2019s create a simpler verbosity judge. It will check whether the responses are concise and to the point. This only requires evaluating one output column: such checks are perfect for production evaluations where you don\\\\u2019t have a reference answer.\\\\n\\\\nHere\\'s how to set up the prompt template for verbosity:\\\\n\\\\n```python\\\\nverbosity = BinaryClassificationPromptTemplate(\\\\n        criteria = \\\\\"\\\\\"\\\\\"Conciseness refers to the quality of being brief and to the point, while still providing all necessary information.\\\\n            A concise response should:\\\\n            - Provide the necessary information without unnecessary details or repetition.\\\\n            - Be brief yet comprehensive enough to address the query.\\\\n            - Use simple and direct language to convey the message effectively.\\\\\"\\\\\"\\\\\",\\\\n        target_category=\\\\\"concise\\\\\",\\\\n        non_target_category=\\\\\"verbose\\\\\",\\\\n        uncertainty=\\\\\"unknown\\\\\",\\\\n        include_reasoning=True,\\\\n        pre_messages=[(\\\\\"system\\\\\", \\\\\"You are an expert text evaluator. You will be given a text of the response to a user question.\\\\\")],\\\\n        )\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\nAdd this new descriptor to our existing dataset:\\\\n\\\\n```python\\\\neval_dataset.add_descriptors(descriptors=[\\\\n    LLMEval(\\\\\"new_response\\\\\",\\\\n            template=verbosity,\\\\n            provider = \\\\\"openai\\\\\",\\\\n            model = \\\\\"gpt-4o-mini\\\\\",\\\\n            alias=\\\\\"Verbosity\\\\\")\\\\n    ])\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\nRun the Report and view the summary results:\\\\u00a0\\\\n\\\\n```python\\\\nreport = Report([\\\\n    TextEvals()\\\\n])\\\\n\\\\nmy_eval = report.run(eval_dataset, None)\\\\nmy_eval\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\n![](/images/examples/llm_judge_tutorial_verbosity-min.png)\\\\n\\\\nYou can also view the dataframe using `eval_dataset.as_dataframe()`\\\\n\\\\n<Info>\\\\n  Don\\'t fully agree with the results? Use these labels as a starting point, edit the decisions where you see fit - now you\\'ve got your golden dataset\\\\\\\\! Next, iterate on your judge prompt. You can also try different evaluator LLMs to see which one does the job better. [How to change an LLM](/metrics/customize_llm_judge#change-the-evaluator-llm).\\\\n</Info>\\\\n\\\\n## What\\'s next?\\\\n\\\\nThe LLM judge itself is just one part of your overall evaluation framework. You can integrate this evaluator into different workflows, such as testing your LLM outputs after changing a prompt.\\\\n\\\\nTo be able to easily run and compare evals, systematically track the results, and interact with your evaluation dataset, you can use the Evidently Cloud platform.\\\\n\\\\n### Set up Evidently Cloud\\\\n\\\\n<CloudSignup />\\\\n\\\\nImport the components to connect with Evidently Cloud:\\\\n\\\\n```python\\\\nfrom evidently.ui.workspace import CloudWorkspace\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\n### Create a Project\\\\n\\\\n<CreateProject />\\\\n\\\\n### Send your eval\\\\n\\\\nSince you already created the eval, you can simply upload it to the Evidently Cloud.\\\\n\\\\n```python\\\\nws.add_run(project.id, my_eval, include_data=True)\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\nYou can then go to the Evidently Cloud, open your Project and explore the Report.\\\\n\\\\n![](/images/examples/llm_judge_tutorial_cloud-min.png)\\\\n\\\\n<Info>\\\\n  You can also [create the LLM judges with no-code](/docs/platform/evals_no_code).\\\\n</Info>\\\\n\\\\n# Reference documentation\\\\n\\\\nSee this page for complete [documentation on LLM judges](/metrics/customize_llm_judge).\"'}</pre>\n",
